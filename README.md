# Challenge
- To create an application that will combine the functionality of shipping paperwork (Bill of Landings, Loading Forms, etc.) and logbooks to create a way to track material across transportation that can be better than current tracking software.

# Solution
- Using Smart Contracts, an application can be created that can record what material is loaded and unloaded onto a particular vehicle and any given time and location. Payments for deliveries can also be worked into the functionality of the smart contracts as well as rest points when material is not moving.

# Why it Matters
- Current tracking software (UPS, FedEx, etc.) can be unreliable if not constantly updated with location data and material can be subject to being delivered to wrong locations or onto the wrong vehicles. This app focuses on minimizing to eliminating that problem by creating a trackable log on the blockchain where users can find out the locations of material at any given point and time and can trace deliveries back to when they were first loaded.
